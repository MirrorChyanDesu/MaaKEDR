> ℹ️ **Project Status: Maintenance Mode**
>
> After completing the daily routine features, this project will enter **maintenance mode**,
> with no active development of new content, only bug fixes and necessary compatibility updates.
>
> For more comprehensive features and active maintenance, please consider the similar open-source project
> [MaaAssistantKedrgame (MAK)](https://github.com/Hollow-YK/MaaAssistantKedrgame).

> 🎵 **Development Approach**
>
> This project was largely developed using **Vibe Coding** — generating code through iterative conversations with an AI assistant (opencode).
> The developer provides requirements, screenshots, ROIs, UI analysis, and validation; the AI implements pipeline logic, Python custom nodes,
> CI/CD configuration, and documentation. This approach greatly improves development efficiency, with code quality ensured by `pnpm check` pipelines.
>
> If you're building a MaaFramework project with AI, this repository can serve as a reference case.
> See [Vibe Coding Development](docs/en_us/develop/vibe-coding.md) for details.  
> This project also maintains [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) as an AI behavior guide to ensure development conventions and consistency.
